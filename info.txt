UDEV rule commands (to find serial #):
	1. After plugging in the device, perform:
	>	dmesg
	2. When the right name is found, perform:
	>	udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACM0 --attribute-walk
	where the /ttyACM0 is the right name
	3. Look for some serial parameter under USB, or TTY. It may look like this: A501VRMT
	4. Put that into the serial in the .rules file
	5. Run make_udev_rules

Launching main.py on Pi startup:
	1. In home directory (NOT git proj dir), create logs directory, using:
	>	mkdir logs 
	2. Change working dir to root of git proj
	3. Make main_launcher.py executable by performing:
	>	chmod 755 main_launcher.sh
	4. Open up a crontab by performing:
	>	sudo crontab -e
	5. Add a new line to start script at boot:
	>	@reboot sh /home/pi/2016-2017-TunnelGeneral/main_launcher.sh >/home/pi/logs/cronlog 2>&1
	6. Ctrl-X to exit, save when prompted
	7. Done! Script will now launch after every Pi bootup
 

Fixing git repo after .gitignore is updated:
	1. Make sure the current working dir is the root of the proj
	2. Run the following commands:
	>	git rm --cached -r .
	>	git add .
	3. Commit with a pretty message and push
