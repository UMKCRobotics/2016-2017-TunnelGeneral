UDEV rule commands (to find serial #):
	1. After plugging in the device, perform:
	>	dmesg
	2. When the right name is found, perform:
	>	udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACM0 --attribute-walk
	where the /ttyACM0 is the right name
	3. Look for some serial parameter under USB, or TTY. It may look like this: A501VRMT
	4. Put that into the serial in the .rules file
	5. Run make_udev_rules

Fixing git repo after .gitignore is updated:
